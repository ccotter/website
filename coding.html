      <h4>Deterministic Linux</h4>
      <p>
The largest and most challenging project I have worked on was
making Linux deterministic. Inspired by the design of another deterministic
operation system described by Aviram et al.'s in
<a href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/det/papers/osdi10.pdf">
  Efficient System-Enforced Deterministic Parallelism</a> paper, I modified
the Linux kernel to support deterministic execution of user programs. I
extended the kernel syscall API adding three new syscalls for deterministic
processes. I wrote a replacement for the standard C library that wraps around
the new syscall interface to provide familiar functionality to application
programmers.

Read my undergraduate thesis, <a href="ccotter-thesis.pdf">
  Enforced Deterministic Program Execution in the Linux Kernel</a> and check
out the source code for the
<a href="http://github.com/ccotter/linux-deterministic">modified kernel</a>
(see the v3.0-det branch) and <a href="http://github.com/ccotter/libdeterm">
user library</a> on Github.
