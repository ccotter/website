        <h4>Deterministic Linux</h4>

<h5>Undergraduate thesis</h5>
<p>
To fulfill my undergraduate thesis degree requirement (and because it was fun),
I worked on the Linux kernel to make Linux deterministic. I began work on this
project under the direction of my advisor,
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mwalfish/">Mike Walfish</a>, in August 2011.
My work was inspired by Determinator, a deterministic operating system described
in Aviram et al.'s
<a href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/det/papers/osdi10.pdf">
  Efficient System-Enforced Deterministic Parallelism</a> paper.

<h5>What I did</h5>
<p>
I modified the x86-64 Linux kernel v3.0 to enforce deterministic execution
of user programs. I primarily worked in the memory management and process
organization (forking, signal handling, low-level synchronization) subsystems.
Deterministic programs are disallowed from using most legacy syscalls (e.g.,
<span class="monospace">write()</span> and
<span class="monospace">open()</span>), so I wrote a replacement for the
standard C library to use the new deterministic syscall API.

        <h4>OpenCoweb</h4>
        <h5>Background</h5>

<p>
<a href="http://opencoweb.org">OpenCoweb</a> is an application framework that
allows developers to create collaborative web applications. The framework
handles sending user events to remote clients. Conflicting events are
automatically resolved using an operational transformation algorithm
</p>
<p>
The framework connects clients with cometd, Bayeux, and WebSockets technologies.
There are two different servers, one written in Java based on the cometd-java
project, and another in Python running the Tornado web server.
The server ferries messages between clients. The framework provides a
JavaScript API for sending and receiving remote events. The operational
transform engine runs in the client's brower to reconcile conflicting
changes.
</p>
<h5>Operational transform</h5>
<p>
The key to the OpenCoweb framekwork is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">
  operational transform</a> (OT) engine OT emerged in the 1980s as a way for
remote clients to communicate and maintain a synchronized document without a
central server. In the centralized server model, each clients communicates with
the server directly, and the server handles conflict resolution. To remove the
requirement of a central server, OT supports true peer-to-peer communication
while guaranteeing a synchronized application state, even in the face of
conflicting application updates. The OT engine runs on all client's machines
and takes as input remote operations and, after a series of transformations,
sends the transformed events to the local instance. The engine resolves
conflicts in a deterministic fashion and ensures that all clients see the same
application state.
</p>
<h5>My contribution</h5>
<p>
OpenCoweb was the first project I worked on at IBM. I started working on the
code in May 2012 when the operation engine and Java server were mature, stable
pieces of code. My job was to maintain the code, fix bugs, write documentation
and contribute to the developer community (i.e., answer
questions). One of the major efforts I worked on was to bring the outdated
Python server code up to date so that the Java and Python servers both had the
same features. Since the 1.0 release milestone, I have played a significantly
reduced role as I have taken on other projects at IBM.

        <h4>JOS Operating System</h4>
        <h5>Background</h5>
<p>
For my undergraduate operating systems course, our course project consisted
of seven
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mwalfish/classes/s11-cs372h/labs.html">
  labs</a>. The labs were centered around
<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/overview.html">JOS</a>, an
instructional operating system developed at MIT. JOS provides skeleton code
for a functioning operating system, and for each lab, we filled in the missing
pieces. The core components of the labs were implementing virtual
memory using x86's two
level page tables, multiprogramming support with a simple scheduler, a file
system, a network driver, and a minimal command line utility (a shell).

I worked alone on the labs, with the exception of our final project, discussed
below. I alo frequently extended JOS to provide interesting features not
required for the labs. These extensions are discussed below.
</p>
<h5>Bootloader</h5>
<p>
To simplify development and debugging, we used QEMU to run our labs. Eventually,
wrote a new bootloader to support newer SATA hard drives so that I could run
JOS on my home desktop.
</p>
<h5>Unix style file system</h5>
<p>
I extended the file system we wrote for one of the labs to support the popular
Unix style file system using inodes. With this improvement, my file system
supported hard linking, multiple directories, and vastly increased file sizes.
</p>
<h5>TCC compiler</h5>
<p>
For my final project, I worked with a partner to port the
<a href="http://bellard.org/tcc/">Tiny C Compiler</a> (TCC) to our run on our
operating system. The majority of our effort was wrapping library calls
in the TCC source code to equivalent functions in our JOS C library. In some
cases, we had to write functions and APIs not provided by JOS. For example, we
wrote our own <span class="monospace">malloc/free</span> since we did not write
them for the JOS labs.
</p>
<p>
We wrote associated utilities (e.g., a text editor to write code for
TCC to compile) and were even able to compile TCC with itself running on JOS.
Eventually, we were able to use TCC to compile the source code to JOS within
JOS and install the compiled kernel to permanent store.
</p>
<h5>Graphical User Interface</h5>
<p>
After porting TCC, my partner and I wrote a graphical windowing system for JOS.
My partner wrote a mini compiler to compile code written in a subset of the
popular <a href="http://processing.org/">processing programming language</a>
to executable binaries supporting a GUI API. We also wrote a mouse driver to
interact with GUI applications (e.g., move windows around).

        <h4>Determining Variable Bit Width</h4>
<p>
For my graduate compilers course, I worked with a partner to implement some of
the functionality described in
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cag/bitwise/bitwise-pldi2k.pdf">Bitwidth
  Analysis with Application to Silicon Compilation</a> by Stephenson et al.
Specifically, we supported forward data
propagation with a fixed point converging algorithm to handle cycles in the
control flow graph (we did not handle backward data flow or use any pointer
analyses). We worked in the LLVM framework to implement a simple iterative
data flow analysis. Interestingly, we found that bit width analysis was able
to propagate constants in all of our test programs, perhaps indicating that bit
width analysis encompasses other analyses.

        <h4>Pipelined Processor</h4>
<p>
For our final project in undergraduate computer architecture, my partner and I
designed and implemented a five stage pipelined uniprocessor written in Verilog.
The inspiration came from the conceptual simple LC3 processor developed by Yale
Patt and Sanjay Patel. To design our pipelined processor, we wrote out a
detailed data path diagrams of the unpipelined LC3 and filled in the logic to
direct the processor the stage its operations. As extra credit, we implemented
a simple two state saturated branch predictor as a global predictor and sixteen
entry local predictor. We simulated our pipelined processor on various programs
and found significant improvement of our unpredicted and predicted versions of
the processor over the unpipelined processor, with the local predictor
performing optimally.
