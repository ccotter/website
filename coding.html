      <h4>Deterministic Linux</h4>
<h5>Undergraduate thesis</h5>
<p>
To fulfill my undergraduate thesis degree requirement (and because it was fun),
I worked on the Linux kernel to make Linux deterministic. I began work on this
project under the direction of my advisor,
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mwalfish/">Mike Walfish</a>, in August 2011.
My work was inspired by Determinator, a deterministic operating system described
in Aviram et al.'s
<a href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/det/papers/osdi10.pdf">
  Efficient System-Enforced Deterministic Parallelism</a> paper.

<h5>What I did</h5>
<p>
I modified the
Linux kernel to support deterministic execution of user programs. I
extended the kernel syscall API adding three new syscalls for deterministic
processes. I wrote a replacement for the standard C library that wraps around
the new syscall interface to provide familiar functionality to application
programmers.

  <h4>OpenCoweb</h4>
      <h5>Background</h5>
<p>
<a href="http://opencoweb.org">OpenCoweb</a> is an application framework that
allows developers to create collaborative web applications. The framework
handles sending user events to remote clients. Conflicting events are
automatically resolved using an operational transformation algorithm
</p>
<p>
The framework connects clients with cometd, Bayeux, and WebSockets technologies.
There are two different servers, one written in Java based on the cometd-java
project, and another in Python running the Tornado web server.
The server ferries messages between clients. The framework provides a
JavaScript API for sending and receiving remote events. The operational
transform engine runs in the client's brower to reconcile conflicting
changes.
</p>
<h5>Operational transform</h5>
<p>
The key to the OpenCoweb framekwork is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">
  operational transform</a> (OT) engine OT emerged in the 1980s as a way for
remote clients to communicate and maintain a synchronized document without a
central server. In the centralized server model, each clients communicates with
the server directly, and the server handles conflict resolution. To remove the
requirement of a central server, OT supports true peer-to-peer communication
while guaranteeing a synchronized application state, even in the face of
conflicting application updates. The OT engine runs on all client's machines
and takes as input remote operations and, after a series of transformations,
sends the transformed events to the local instance. The engine resolves
conflicts in a deterministic fashion and ensures that all clients see the same
application state.
</p>
<h5>My contribution</h5>
<p>
OpenCoweb was the first project I worked on at IBM. I started working on the
code in May 2012 when the operation engine and Java server were mature, stable
pieces of code. My job was to maintain the code, fix bugs, write documentation
and contribute to the developer community (i.e., answer
questions). One of the major efforts I worked on was to bring the outdated
Python server code up to date so that the Java and Python servers both had the
same features. Since the 1.0 release milestone, I have played a significantly
reduced role as I have taken on other projects at IBM.
